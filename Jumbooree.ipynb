        "Business context\n",
        "----------------\n",
        "\n",
        "Jamboree has launched an online “Chance of Admit” checker for study-abroad aspirants. The tool should be credible, transparent, and useful for counselling teams and marketing funnels. We need a data-driven model that explains what drives admits and gives an accurate probability estimate for each student profile.\n",
        "\n",
        "Objective\n",
        "---------\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Primary**: Build an interpretable regression model to estimate **Chance of Admit** for an applicant, given profile attributes.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Secondary**: Identify the **key drivers** that most influence admit probability and quantify their impact so counselling can guide students on practical improvements.\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "Decisions this will enable\n",
        "--------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Student guidance**: What to improve first (GRE, TOEFL, SOP, LOR, GPA, research) to meaningfully lift admit chance.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Lead qualification**: Prioritise high potential leads for counsellor follow-ups.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Content and prep strategy**: Which score bands and profile gaps to target in blogs, ads, and workshops.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Scholarship or premium service targeting**: Identify segments with strong lift potential.\n",

        "Target variable and inputs\n",
        "--------------------------\n",

        "*   **Target**: Chance of Admit (0 to 1).\n",

        "*   **Scope**: Supervised regression with **explanatory focus**.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Baseline**: OLS Linear Regression using statsmodels to get coefficients, p-values, confidence intervals, and model diagnostics.\n",
        "    \n",

        "    \n",
        "*   **Assumption checks**: VIF for multicollinearity, residual mean near zero, linearity via residual plots, homoscedasticity, and normality of residuals.\n",

        "\n",
        "Success criteria\n",
        "----------------\n",

        "*   **Quality**: Reasonable Train vs Test parity on **MAE, RMSE, R², Adjusted R²** with no obvious overfit.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Interpretability**: Clear ranking of drivers and practical interpretation of coefficients.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Calibration**: Predicted probabilities align with observed bands on hold-out data.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Actionability**: Concrete recommendations that a student can act on to lift chances.\n",
        "    \n",

        "Constraints and considerations\n",

        "*   **Model performance**: Both the base Linear Regression and Ridge Regression models performed strongly, explaining ~81% of the variance in admission chances (R² ≈ 0.81, RMSE ≈ 0.06). The Lasso model, while useful for feature selection, did not improve predictive accuracy in this dataset.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Feature importance**: The engineered Total Score (combined GRE, TOEFL, and CGPA) emerged as the most influential predictor of admit probability. Among qualitative variables, **Letter of Recommendation (LOR)** and **Research Experience** showed significant positive contributions, while **University Rating** and **SOP Strength** had limited standalone impact.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Collinearity considerations**: The original exam-related features (GRE, TOEFL, CGPA) were highly correlated with each other. Consolidating them into a single Total Score feature improved interpretability and reduced multicollinearity without reducing model accuracy.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Assumption validation**: All major assumptions of linear regression were satisfied — residuals showed linearity and homoscedasticity, and VIF values indicated no serious multicollinearity. Although the Shapiro-Wilk test flagged residuals as not perfectly normal, both histogram and Q-Q plots showed only minor deviations, acceptable for practical regression use.\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "👉 **Business takeaway**: Admission outcomes are primarily determined by **academic strength**, with **research exposure and strong recommendations** acting as key differentiators. SOPs and University Rating play a marginal role in this dataset, but could matter in borderline or subjective cases.\n",

        "*   **Model choice**: For interpretability, OLS remains the preferred baseline, while Ridge can be deployed in production for coefficient stability if future features increase multicollinearity. Lasso is useful when feature selection is required on larger datasets.\n",

        "*   **Business application**: The model can be integrated into Jamboree’s admission counselling platform as a **“Chance of Admit Estimator”**, guiding students on where to invest efforts (e.g., improve GRE/CGPA, pursue research, strengthen LORs). This not only supports students but also helps Jamboree **prioritise high-potential leads** and tailor services more effectively."
